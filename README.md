# Beginner-Friendly Pomodoro Timer

## About

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a Pomodoro Timer, a technique that helps you manage your time effectively and stay focused while working or studying. Even if you're new to coding, this project aims to provide you with a hands-on introduction to programming concepts in a practical way.

## What is a Pomodoro Timer?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals called "Pomodoros." Each Pomodoro is typically 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. After completing a set number of Pomodoros, you take a longer break. This technique encourages productivity, focus, and helps prevent burnout.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**: The timer counts down from 25 minutes (one Pomodoro).
- **Start/Pause Button**: Click the "Start" button to begin the timer. Click it again to pause.
- **Reset Button**: Reset the timer to 25 minutes at any time.
- **Visual and Audio Alerts**: Get notified when the timer completes a Pomodoro.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin a Pomodoro timer.
3. Work on your task until the timer rings.
4. Take a short break during the 5-minute break period.
5. After completing a few Pomodoros, take a longer break.

## Why I Created This Project

I decided to create this project to help my sister manage her time more effectively. She often finds herself spending too much time on distractions and wanted a simple tool to help her stay on track. This Pomodoro Timer can be a helpful way to improve focus and productivity.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the timer.

## Contribution

If you're new to coding, this is a great project to get your hands dirty with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Feel free to customize, enhance, or share your own versions of the timer.
